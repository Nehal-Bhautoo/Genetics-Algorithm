**The Travelling Salesman Problem**

The coursework is to build a system in Java that solves travelling salesman problems. The travelling salesman problem is to go to each city exactly once and return to the start. Solving the problem should give a path and the length of the path. There are optimal solutions, that is solutions with the shortest path.

Sample files are provided below. They have n lines for n cities. The first integer in the line is the city number (starting with 1 and ending with n) and the second and third integers are the X and Y coordinates of the city. Distance is standard Euclidean distance.
